## Hybrid Analysis using Machine Learning 

Dataset couldn't be uploaded due to security reasons, but no need to worry as you can download malware samples from https://das-malwerk.herokuapp.com/
Download any malware that is in PE format and put them in a folder, and just run the code



# Pre-req Libraries:
1- PEFILE 
2- Numpy
3- OS
4- pandas
5- sklearn 

# Instructions:

Run ReadingDataset.py first to read the headers from the PE files in the dataset. Make sure to put the path of your dataset folder in the code
Run FinalCode.py for static analysis score and dynamic analysis score, which results in the hybrid analysis score at the end.
